<!-- <p>It's all flannel and beard up in here,</p>
<p>suspenders and boots and clothes flecked with wood-</p>
<p>smellin of balsam and fir and aspen</p> -->
<p>There are strange things done in the midnight sun</p>
<p>By the men who moil for gold;</p>
<p>The Arctic trails have their secret tales</p>
<p>That would make your blood run cold;</p>
<p>The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,</p>
<p>But the queerest they ever did see</p>
<p>Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge</p>
<p>I cremated Sam McGee.</p>
